This assignment has helped me enhance my knowledge by going through intresting topics of python, c++, and shell scripting.According to it's level it's divided into 3 parts:

1. [Light Dose](#Light-Dose)
1. [Medium Dose](#Medium-Dose)
1. [Strong Dose](#Strong-Dose)

## Light Dose
In light dose i executed some linux commands like: 
    - mkdir to make directory,
    - cd to change directory,
    - cd .. to come out of directory,
    - ls to show files in directory,
    - echo for printing output,
    - rm to delete directory.  
And i also wrote a code for finding a file with extension .txt and moified it into .bak extension while saving it in another folder.
While doing this i learnt basic commands of shell scripting like how to make a file using vim and how to print data using echo. 
## Medium Dose
In medium dose i learnt the basic syntax of C++ language which was very similar to C language and after that i was able to understand C++ much better after doing some problems.
In C++ i learnt OOP concept which was quite unique as classes were like structure with additional features like having it's own function and also having privacy using:
    - private,
    - public, 
    - protected,
areas.  
## Strong Dose
In strong dose i got to sharpen my knowledge of python as i have known it's syntax but not done much problem so this problem helped me use tupple,list e.t.c. and also i got to learn about PILLOW library which deals with images and pixels using which i was able to solve the second question.
